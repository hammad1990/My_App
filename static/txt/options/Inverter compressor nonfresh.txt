In the cooling mode, as the Return Air Temperature rises above the Set point, the VFD Compressor will stage on and modulate to control to the Set point.
If additional cooling is required, the VFD Compressor continues to modulate up to its maximum capacity.
To stage up the extra compressor(s), the Return Air Temperature needs to be above the Set point and the VFD Compressor needs to be at 100% then second compressor is enabled & VFD compressor will go to minimum capacity and modulate up as needed.
To stage down the extra compressor(s), the Return Air Temperature needs to be below the Set point and the VFD Compressor needs to be at 0% for a period of time equal to the Stage Down Delay.
For compressors to stage down, Minimum Run Times must be satisfied as well as Stage Down Delays (adjustable). The VFD compressor is always the last compressor to be deactivated.
