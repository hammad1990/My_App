The compressor (s) start/stop command is a function of return air temperature. Once set point (SP) has been established for
return air temperature, the action taken by the controller to bring the system as near to the set point as possible will be
proportional to the systems distance from set point. 
Once a proportional band(DF) has been established around the set point, the controller will produce the most limited action
at the set point whilst controller performance will increase No. of required compressor by one as return air temp deviates 
more and more from its target. if return air temperature increase to the: SP+DF, all compressors will be ON.
