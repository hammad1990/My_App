if defrost air temp became below specific degree, e.g. (-2c) and condenser coil differential pressure became above adjusted 
setpoint, then unit will go to defrost cycle in which 4-way valve will reverse and compressors will work for at least minimum 
time (3 min)  until defrost air temp become above setpoint, e.g.(10c)  to remove the ice on condenser coil. After that the 
unit will return back to heat pump mode.
